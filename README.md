## Assignment 1

### Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

#### Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

- Takes two numbers as input from the user.
- Performs **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** on these numbers.
- Displays the result of each operation clearly on the screen.

#### Expected Output

The output should display the result of each operation, for example:

```
Enter the first number: 8
Enter the second number: 4

Addition: 12
Subtraction: 4
Multiplication: 32
Division: 2.0
```

### Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

#### Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

- Takes the user's **first name** and **last name** as input.
- Concatenates them into a **full name**.
- Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.

#### Expected Output

The output should display a greeting such as:

```
Enter your first name: Ravi
Enter your last name: Gohil

Hello, Ravi Gohil! Welcome to the Python learning journey.
```

## Assignment 2

### Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

#### Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

- Takes an integer input from the user.
- Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
- Displays the result accordingly.

#### Expected Output

The program should display output like:

```
Enter a number: 7
The number 7 is odd.
```

### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

#### Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

- Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
- Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
- Displays the final sum.

#### Expected Output

The program should display:

```
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
```
